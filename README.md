# AnimeListKata

This project is intended to be a kata, or practice project, to learn and practice Java.

The heart of the project is going to be an Anime list, where we can do things like:

1. Allow a user to keep a list of their favorite animes
2. Allow multiple users
3. Allow a user to re-order their list of favorite animes
4. Allow user to add or remove from their list
5. Allow users to see other users lists

This project will start of simple. A simple Java project using Maven. As it gets developed, it may become a java web application or it may turn into a microservice backend that will have a separate project for the front end. Or it may go stale and get no work done. Who knows :D
